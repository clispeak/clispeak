# 21. A stale socket is reclaimed only after a connection is refused

**Status:** Accepted.

**Decision.** When binding the local socket returns `AddrInUse`, the node
tries to *connect* to it. A refused connection means the name outlived the
process that held it, and only then is it overwritten.

**Why this needed deciding at all.** `ipc.rs` said the socket is namespaced so
cleanup is not our problem. That is true on Linux, where the abstract
namespace discards the name with the process, and false everywhere else. Off
Linux the name is a file: a crash or a `kill -9` leaves it behind, every node
started afterwards fails to bind, and every CLI call reaches the corpse and is
refused — so the tool reports "no voicecast node is running" with the app
plainly on screen. Nothing recovers from that without deleting a file whose
location the design deliberately never mentions.

**Why not simply overwrite.** `interprocess` will displace a listener that is
still accepting connections, so overwriting on `AddrInUse` alone would let a
second node quietly steal the socket from a running one, and the CLI would
reach whichever won. That is a worse failure than the one being fixed, and a
silent one. Connecting is the only test that distinguishes a live node from a
dead one's leftovers.

**Consequences.** No platform conditional, so the portability rule still
holds — and the fix applies on Linux too, where the bug was merely unreachable
rather than absent. There is a narrow race between the refused connection and
the overwrite; a lock file would close it and would be worse, because a stale
lock file is the same class of bug one level further down.

This was found by running macOS for the first time, which is what the
compile-for-five rule was always meant to make cheap. The rule held: the
defect was in a portable crate and had been latent everywhere.
