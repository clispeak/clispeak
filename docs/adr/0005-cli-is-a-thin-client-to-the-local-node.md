# 5. CLI is a thin client to the local node

**Status:** Accepted.

**Decision.** `voicecast` writes to a local IPC socket and exits. The long-running
Tauri app owns the identity and connections.

**Why.** A short-lived process would pay full connection setup — endpoint
creation, discovery, hole-punching — on *every* invocation. That's 200ms–2s per
message, unusable for an agent firing off notifications. Through a warm socket
it's single-digit milliseconds.

**Cost.** The CLI depends on the app. Mitigation: autostart it if not running
(~1s cold, fast thereafter).
