# 10. Fire-and-forget by default, confirmation opt-in

**Status:** Accepted.

**Decision.** `voicecast` returns as soon as the local node accepts the message.
`--wait` blocks for per-target terminal status; `--json` emits it structured.

**Why.** The caller is an agent that may fire many messages. Blocking on
playback by default would make it a latency source in someone's agent loop.
But an agent sometimes genuinely needs to know a message landed, so the
information has to be *available* — just not mandatory.

**Cost.** Two code paths, and exit codes have to mean different things
depending on `--wait`.
