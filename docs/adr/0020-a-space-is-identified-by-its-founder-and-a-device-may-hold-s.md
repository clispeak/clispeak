# 20. A space is identified by its founder, and a device may hold several

**Status:** Accepted.

**Decision.** A space's id is `<founder endpoint id>:<founder joined_at>`, and
a device keeps a map of them with a local label each and one marked default.

**Why an id at all.** Two devices that share more than one space have to agree
which one a message belongs to, or membership of the family space would
authorise speaking in the work one.

**Why derived rather than generated.** Every member has to arrive at the same
id without being told, including devices whose rosters were written before
spaces existed. The founder is the one member whose entry vouches for itself,
so every member can compute the id from a roster it already holds — and the
founding timestamp separates two spaces founded by the same device, which is
exactly what rotating produces. Generating a random id would have needed a
migration that every device performed identically, which is not something a
peer-to-peer system can arrange.

**Consequences.** Adding the id to the wire is backwards compatible: it is
optional, and a message without one is placed by looking up where the sender
is already known from, which is unambiguous whenever two devices share a
single space. Labels are local, like device names, and must be unique on the
device because they qualify device names — `work/laptop` cannot mean two
things.

`all` is scoped to one space and there is deliberately no selector meaning
"everywhere". Crossing spaces has to be spelled out, because a work message
arriving on the family tablet is the failure separate spaces exist to prevent.

Per-space receiver settings — separate mute, quiet hours and volume for each —
are specified in `cli.md` but not built. Policy is currently per device.
