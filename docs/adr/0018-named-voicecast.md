# 18. Named `voicecast`

**Status:** Accepted.

**Decision.** The project and its CLI are `voicecast`. Crates are
`voicecast-core`, `voicecast-cli`, `voicecast-proto`, `voicecast-text`,
`voicecast-engine`.

**Why "cast".** The distinguishing feature is not that it speaks — plenty of
tools do — but that it **fans out to many devices at once**. `--to all` is
literally casting. Broadcast semantics describe the product better than speech
semantics do.

**Why not `agentcast`.** Taken on crates.io by a dormant crate, and — the
decisive part — taken on npm by an *actively developed* AI-agent tool. A
near-identical name in the same niche would interleave in every search result.
`agent-cast` was free but a hyphen is thin separation from an active neighbour.

**Why not `agent-speak`.** Free on crates.io, but AgentSpeak(L) is an
established agent-oriented programming language with decades of literature
behind it. Bad for a name whose job is being findable.

**Why no `agent-` prefix at all.** It names the caller rather than the
function, and the tool is not agent-only — piping a file is in the design. The
README's first line carries that framing better than the name would, and it
will age better.

**Free on both crates.io and npm**, no PATH collision, no trademark.
